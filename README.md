`vim-sessionHelper` is designed to help with the creation and management of
sessions. It distinguishes between three kinds of sessions:

1. **Ad hoc sessions**, which the user can create, open (and modify or delete)
   as needed via the commands below. These sessions are stored in files
prefixed by "adhoc-", though that prefix is abstracted away from the user.

2. **Permanent sessions**, which are vimscript files located in the `sessions`
   directory. They can only be *opened* via the `:SessionOpen` command. As an
example, the file `~/.vim/sessions/v.vim` might contain:

        edit ~/.vim
        lcd ~/.vim

    This will open the vim directory in netrw and cd to that directory. This is
    handy for jumping around to frequently used directories within vim.

3. **Autosaved sessions**, which can be automatically created (and deleted) via
   autocommands, saving a snapshot of the current vim session. These session
files cannot be manually saved via `:SessionSave`, but they can be opened and
deleted via the commands below. For example, the following will automatically
write (or overwrite) the `default` autosave session just before exiting vim:

        autocmd VimLeave * call execute 'mksession!' g:sessionHelperDirectory . 'autosave-default.vim'

    Using `:SessionOpen`, the autosave session can be opened manually, or the
    following will automatically load the default autosave:

        autocmd VimEnter * SessionOpen autosave-default

    (Note that `:SessionOpen` will print a warning if the corresponding file
    does not exist.)

# Commands

The following commands do the mostly obvious things:

1. `:SessionOpen`

2. `:SessionSave`

3. `:SessionDelete`

4. `:SessionOpenDelete`: this will open a session file and simultaneously
delete it in one step.

Note that you can use command-line completion on ad-hoc session names, and that
issuing the command with no argument will present a list of all sessions
(including permanent sessions) to choose from.

# Customization

## Suggested Mappings

I suggest the following mappings for easy access. (Note that each one has a
single trailing space.)

    nnoremap <LocalLeader>so :SessionOpen 
    nnoremap <LocalLeader>ss :SessionSave 
    nnoremap <LocalLeader>sd :SessionDelete 
    nnoremap <LocalLeader>sO :SessionOpenDelete 

## Variables

There is one variable that determines the location of mappings, which by
default is set as follows:

    let g:sessionHelperDirectory = expand("$HOME") . "/.vim/sessions/"

If the specified directory does not currently exist, it will be created.
